### CTRNN
The CTRNN is the subclass of the network from Flatland project. In addition we added to neurons attributes (bias weight, gain, time constant) needed for CTRNN output computation.

The motor output is formed by two neurons (each represent one directions), which gives output in $(0,1)$. The tracker direction is decided by the neuron which gives higher value. The speed of the tracker is then computed from the value of the "winning" neuron. By multiply this value by 5 we scresale its output to the 4 possible speeds. 

With pull extension we gave to output layer one more neuron. It has the same properties as the others in this layer. Output is intepret as to make a pull action if it is higher than the value $0.5$.

## b) Performance

### Standard scenario

In the standard scenario, agent always choose at the beginning one direction which then hold for all the simulation. Its behaviour under the objects is various, depending on run of our EA. Two main approaches can be seen:

- It is going fast and first run through the world it "scans" the object and in the second it stops under if it is small object.

- It is going slower and when it is under object it tries to catch it at the end part. If it sees that object is big, it just pass without stop under it.

Our trackers has problems with catching objects while they appear immediately above them after they caught something. Usually they just continue with the relaxing and don't try to avoid/catch object. 

Every time object hits the floor fitness function is computed. We have punishment for not taking small object and not avoid big one, then we have rewards for taking small object and avoid big one. Fitness is given as the sum. This is the same for all scenarios, except the non wraparound (see No-Wrap section).

### Pull scenario
With the pull scenario agent behaves similarly as in the standard case. When it just stopped in the standard case and waited for the object, now he use pull action to get the object faster. Sometimes immediately after it takes the pull action it use it also for bigger object. On the figure is shown how EA first learn capture objectsm then the second graph jump captures learn use pull action.

### No-Wrap scenario

This scenario is probably the most difficult for our EA, because evolving rational behaving agent needs more luck. With this scenario we added to the input sensors two more sensors detecting walls (on the right and on the left). We also make weights from this inputs twice bigger as the rest weights. We managed to educate agent which can turn after hit the wall as well as capturing objects (it was not able to avoid bigger ones). However, educating good agents demands many runs of EA and it is very sensitive to initial conditions, so we change fitness function to help agents to learn turn after hit wall. When some agent turns, he is given a big reward for this behaviour. He can obtain this reward only few times per its live, since we want to avoid hitting only wall all the time. This approach was showed to be good since agent learns both capturing objects and turn after hit wall. The develop is shown on the picture, where is perceptible two jumps, first turn from the wall, second capture objects.

## c) CTRNN Analysis

We use the same topology as was in the assignment. Lets mark neuron from the input layer as $i_1, \dots, i_5$, neurons from the hidden layer as $h_1, h_2$, neurons from the motor output layer as $o_1, o_2$ and the bias neuron as $b$. One of the evolved ANN weights are followed:

|to\from| $i_1$ | $i_2$ | $i_3$ | $i_4$ | $i_5$ | $h_1$ | $h_2$ | $o_1$ | $o_2$ |  $b$  |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| $h_1$ |  5.0  |-4.647 |-4.058 |-1.274 |  5.0  | 2.019 | 2.294 |       |       |-1.019 |
| $h_2$ |-3.862 | 0.098 | 3.980 |-2.960 |  5.0  | 1.352 | 3.0   |       |       |-0.352 |
| $o_1$ |       |       |       |       |       | 2.176 | -1.0  |  1.0  | -3.0  |-0.705 |
| $o_2$ |       |       |       |       |       |  -3.0 | 4.294 |  1.0  |  5.0  |-9.019 | 

|              | $h_1$ | $h_2$ | $o_1$ | $o_2$ |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|gains         | 4.921 | 3.996 | 2.003 | 2.992 |
|time constants| 1.0   | 1.250 | 1.003 | 2.0   |


Agent with this weights is always taking left direction. It is well seen on the biases that the bias for the right motor output is very low, so agent never take action to the right (since we deciding based on the maximum of the outputs of the motor output neurons). The weights for the borders of tracker are the most important (to detect if the object is above the tracker), so their weights are extreme. Left motor output needs more information from the $h_1$, because he need to underfly big object if there is some. Thus the weight from this neuron is bigger. The second output neuron gives the left output feedback when it sees the object and thus value of the left is getting lower and tracker stops. So the weights from this left output are very low to allow make the output from left output neuron very low.

If we take network with previous given weights and the three inputs `[[1,1,1,1,0], [1,1,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0]]` its output after last will be `[0.9928198173818509, 1.944821830446952e-13]`. However, if we try to use the same network with the same initial state with different first two inputs `[[1,1,1,1,0], [1,1,1,0,0], 1,1,0,0,0]]` its output will be `[0.5764259499298425, 1.5154171154892676e-10]`.

If we give our network inputs `[[1,1,1,0,0], [1,1,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0,0]]` we are given outputs `[0.1004982589701444, 1.7124585674299352e-05], [0.04159479854050314, 3.204724235117445e-06],[0.03441738614485795, 1.6194432630797721e-06]`, it is corresponding with the agent behaviour when it stops under object (that first output is getting lower is given by the feedback from the second output node which takes it down). If we "let object fall" from the other side, i.e. inputs `[[0,0,1,1,1], [0,0,1,1,1],[0,0,1,1,1]]` output of the network is `[0.7243432766232919, 1.0510463627465613e-05], [0.9159772553264353, 9.160789065372894e-08], [0.9414226330411551, 1.1391061986261452e-08]`, thus we can see tracker will not stop. It corresponds with our observation that tracker can't handle when objects fall immediately on it (since he miss input from first neuron and thus lowing feedback).
